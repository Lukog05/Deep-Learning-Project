The images uploaded here are AI generated. 
We have generated the 10 images atleast for each of the 7 emotions present in the given directory.
We had to use mutliple image generators as a lot of faces produced by the generators were too animated or unrealistic.
Also, very few image generators had the capability in built to them to produce recgonizable emotions on the generated faces.
This is beacuse of the privacy feature embedded into them, so that very realistic images are not generated by people and misused.
Some of the websties for getting these images are Rubbrband, TensorArt, Claude to name a few.
We also had to resize the images to needed 48x48 dimensions by ourselves as none of the ai tools natively produce the images in the mentioned dimension.
