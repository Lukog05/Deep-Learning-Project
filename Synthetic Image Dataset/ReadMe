The images uploaded here are AI generated. 
We have generated the 10 images atleast for each of the 7 emotions present in the given directory.
We had to use mutliple image generators as a lot of faces produced by the generators were too animated or unrealistic.
This is beacuse of the privacy feature embedded into them, so that very realistic images are not generated by people and misused.
Also, a lot of these image generators as limited in the range of emotions they can produce to have on faces of people. 
For instance, almost all of them can produce happy and face faces but very few of them can produce images with emotions such as disgust.
Some of the websties for getting these images are Rubbrband, TensorArt, Claude to name a few.
We also had to resize the images to needed 48x48 dimensions by ourselves as none of the ai tools natively produce the images in the mentioned dimension.
